DESCRIPTION

This module enables conversion from and to the ASCII format of german texts.

It has two methods: C<to_ascii> and C<to_latin1> which one do exactly what they say.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The self test is very intensive,
it may need 10 minutes as it tests with a huge german word list.
If it is to long for, just look for the first few seconds,
if no error occurs up till then, it shouldn't happen in the remaining minutes and
it should be O.K. to skip the remaining test.
(And to give you a feeling, a progress bar is shown)

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Test::More (only for testing)

If you want a nicer feeling when testing and waiting,
you should also install
